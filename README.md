Housing Market Metrics | Visualizations in Power BI
- By Tanner Earsley
- Created 6/25/2025

---

## Project Overview
- Capture key metrics and data from real-world housing data  
- Present insights through interactive, digestible dashboards 
- Explore trends based on listing price, square footage, location, and listing time

---

## Dashboard Structure
- 3 pages are present in this project: a main dashboard, a table of general information, and a key takeaways dashboard
- Dashboards are meant to be viewed **sequentially**, with interactivity through filters and hover effects  
- The first page shows larger scale visuals such as graphs and charts, whereas the final table shows individual data points and smaller displays of information.
